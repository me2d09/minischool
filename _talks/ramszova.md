This research project aims to combine the catalytic and optical properties of silver with the magnetic properties of spinel ferrite into one unique core-shell nanostructure. 
The focus is on the synthesis of nanoheterostructures and the study of the interface and origin of the coupling of two different physical properties. Such magnetoopticlal core-shell nanoparticles have a high potential for the biomedical and technologigal applications.

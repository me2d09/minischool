Zeolite imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) represent a relatively new class of porous three-dimensional metal-organic frameworks. This work is devoted to the study of the specific heat, magnetization and susceptibility of [{Zn (mIm)<sub>2</sub> · 2H<sub>2</sub>O}<sub>∞</sub>] (ZIF-8) and [{Cu (mIm)<sub>2</sub> · 2H<sub>2</sub>O}<sub>∞</sub>] (Cu-ZIF-8), where HmIm = 2-methylimidazole = C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. The sample Cu-ZIF-8 can be considered a structural analog of ZIF-8, since it was found that partial replacement of the Zn(II) ion for Cu(II) did not lead to the significant change in the crystal structure. Extremely low values of Cu-ZIF-8 magnetization (~0.01 μB) were recorded at 2 K in the field 5 T. Temperature dependence of susceptibility shows at 130 K a broad maximum typical for low-dimensional systems which can be described by the model of S =1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain. This fact explains the absence of corresponding anomaly in the specific heat. However, unlike susceptibility, specific heat shows a round maximum at about 300 mK. The application of magnetic field supresses the maximum and shifts it towards higher temperatures.  The understanding of such rather peculiar behaviour requires further studies.

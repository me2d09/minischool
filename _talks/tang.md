  title: "Development of an indirect spectrometer Mushroom"

Mushroom is a concept of an indirect neutron spectrometer with its secondary spectrometer based on
a super flat-cone analyser with an array of position-sensitive detectors (PSD) below it. This combination
of the analyser and PSDs gives the complete information of the outgoing wave vectors from each detected
point on the PSDs. The idea has been rst presented by R. Bewley for a new spectrometer at the
spallation source ISIS in the UK. We aim to adapt the Mushroom concept to the reactor source at FRM
II, such that a much higher count rate can be reached than at a traditional triple-axis spectrometer
(TAS). This is possible thanks to the special analyser in Mushroom covering a solid angle up to 1.33Ï€ sr,
which is only around 0:001 sr at a TAS. This allows an overview of the dispersion relation and/or diffuse
scattering with only a few scans. We present the calculations and rst simulations showing predictions
on the instrument performance.

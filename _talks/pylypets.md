Ferroelectric superlattices attract scientistsâ€™ attention
because of novel effects which occur there in comparison to bulk materials.
Recently, scientists from the group of Dr. Zubko group (UCL, London)
have prepared 100 nm thin films consisting of alternating lead and strontium
titanate layers and succeeded to released them from the substrate.
These free-standing thin films are found in the form of stripes or
spontaneously formed microtubes, both with dimensions 10-100 microns.
This work reports Raman spectroscopy investigations of the pronounced changes
in the internal structure of such free-standing films.

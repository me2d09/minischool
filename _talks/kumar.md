Frustrated magnetism is defined by the impossibility of simultaneously satisfying all the magnetic interactions acting in a given system, and electric dipolar moments were previously identified in some frustrated magnets. In my work, we are going to study the magnetoelectric coupling in frustrated magnets and its consequences.

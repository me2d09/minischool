Quenching is the spontaneous drop in the magnetic field, e.g., caused by a thermal runaway or a flux jump, where the absolute zero resistance state in superconducting magnet coils is suddenly lost. Due to their slow quench propagation, coils produced from high-temperature superconductors (HTS) are prone to local thermal damage. The new metal-insulator technology resides in coating of the superconductor with conducting over nonconducting materials reacting to reduce the risk of quench damage. In this project, we develop a demonstrator coil to investigate the quench characteristics of metal-insulated HTS coils, going towards a new generator of coils for neutron scattering sample environment.

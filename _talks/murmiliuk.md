Rational design of nanomaterials aimed for targeted drug delivery requires understanding of the basic principles of the complex relationship between their morphology, structure and loading or release properties that is the goal of our fundamental research.

In our work we used two approaches for designing nanocapsules of core/shell structure: (i) self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers and (ii) co-assembly of copolymer consisting of neutral hydrophilic and polyelectrolyte block with oppositely charged polyelectrolyte.

Firstly, we studied co-assembly of diblock copolymer composed of polycationic and neutral hydrophilic block with polyanion, and we showed that they form core/shell micelles with interpolyelectrolyte (IPEC) core. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy, we proved that IPEC core remains dynamical after equilibration of the system so that the chains rearrange even after the complex is already formed, so that such micelles can be used for encapsulation of multivalent solutes.

Secondly, we showed that amphiphilic block copolymer composed of hydrophobic block that has low glass transition temperature and of polycation block forms core/shell micelle with fluid core and positively charged shell, and thus can be used for encapsulation of hydrophobic solutes.

Finally, we combined both approaches and discovered that core/shell micelles with soft core and positively charged shell co-assemble with diblock copolymer composed of neutral hydrophilic block and polyanion block into compartment structures containing both soft hydrophobic and interpolyelectrolyte layers. Using small-angle neutron scattering we confirmed a vesicle-like structure with both IPEC and soft layers. Thanks to their unique tunable properties, such multicompartment micelles can be used as nanocapsules with controllable thickness of each layer, charge and stability.

A clear contrast of low-temperature properties between the crystalline and amorphous solids is continuously observed for over five decades. Such behaviour of amorphous solids is general for most disordered materials and is known as universal “anomalous” behaviour at low temperatures. Our analysis combines the Soft-Potential model and nanocluster approximation in order to identify the possible sources of the low-temperature anomalies.

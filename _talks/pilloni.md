The project is dedicated to investigating the intricate synergy between the magneto-optical properties of the core and the plasmonic behavior of noble metal shells in multiphase CSNPs with narrow size-distribution. The study of the magneto-plasmonic effects originated due to the internal strain at the interface between core and shell aim to understand the coupling mechanisms at a microscopic level. Several techniques will be used to characterize the CS structure (HRTEM, SAXS, PXRD, SANSPOL) in order to clarify size-distribution, shape and magnetic properties, which play a key role in determining the magneto-plasmonic properties. Among them, neutron scattering experiments will serve as a critical tool to probe and elucidate this dynamic interplay, providing deeper insight into the fundamental physics that govern magneto-plasmonic systems.

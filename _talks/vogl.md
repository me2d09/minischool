  title: "How simulation programs aid large-scale research facilities with limited experiment time"

Some large scale research facilities as the frm2 have the problem of limited research time due to the nature of the facility. In the case of the frm2, this is the beam time: 60 days on neutron flow 3-4 time a year. In an effort to allocate as little time as possible for training the operators on the real experiment we are implementing a virtual instrument into the control software to train in off time.

Besides the fact that Li-ion batteries are nowadays widely used in electronic devices such as smartphones, energy storage devices and electric vehicles, climate change and decreasing availability of fossil fuel are driving the development of Li-ion batteries with higher energy and power density at lower cost. Therefore, analyzing the degradation mechanisms of real Li-ion batteries is of particular interest to understand the internal processes during the electrochemical cycle and improve the performance of future batteries. In this contribution, the focus is set on the electrode materials of Li-ion batteries, which are analyzed by various techniques such as neutron and X-ray diffraction, electrochemical measurements, SEM, DSC/TGA and ICP-OES.

Metal organic magnets have enormous potential to host a variety of electronic and magnetic phases that originate from a strong interplay between the spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom. We recently evaluated the system [Cu(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>(pyz)<sub>2</sub>]Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, down to mK temperatures, without deuteration. Despite those challenges, the full dispersions along the b- and c-axes were easily measured using the cold triple-axis spectrometer IN12 at ILL.

Assuming strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) in-plane coupling in the quasi-square lattice of the b-c-plane and a weak out-of-plane coupling in between, we constructed a Hamiltonian of the system. The model was refined through fitting the data with linear spin-wave theory and allowed the extraction of preferential spin directions, by comparing the relative intensities of the excitations along the c- and b-axes without direct observation of the magnetic ground state.

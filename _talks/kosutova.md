Nano is the fancy prefix these days, but what does it really comprise? And where do the unique properties different from the bulk material come from? How do nanoparticles behave when they are heated up? For nanoparticle preparation, we use a bottom up method, the aggregation from the gas phase. I will show you why we examine these nanoparticles by x-ray diffraction and scattering and what we can find out. By the x-ray methods, we are also able to easily study the processes in the nanoparticle layers in-situ, which is necessary for understanding basic mechanisms and important for numerous applications.

At the present time, properties of thin layers and multilayered nanostructures are intensively reseacrched. Because of different properties than bulk materials, thin layers have found application in various fields and play a key role in many technologies. Nanostructures containing GdOx are intensively studied since their properties can be modified by voltage application. It is assumed, that this change is caused by migration of ions in the structure. We are conducting research on multilayered structures, whose optical response changes reversibly by applying voltage. In these samples, the change is likely caused by migration of hydrogen ions into the GdOx layer. The goal of research is to describe the optical properties of individual layers of the structure and to describe the dynamic change in optical properties. The measurements are conducted with the help of spectroscopic ellipsometry, which allows *in situ* voltage application.

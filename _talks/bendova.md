Magnetism in van der Waals (vdW) materials represent a fascinating part of today's condensed matter physics. The focus was especially brought to layered two-dimensional materials since they have a big potential for next spintronic and optoelectronic devices generation due to their properties associated with spin dynamics. My work focuses on vdW trihalides such as VBr3, UI3 and VCl3 which were prepared in single crystal form and analyzed for their crystal structure and magnetic and anisotropy properties.

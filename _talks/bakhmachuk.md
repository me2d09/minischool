Australasian tektites (AAT), glasses produced by a meteoritic impact 788 ka ago, are found on nearly one-sixth of the Earth's surface; however, the parent crater position remains unknown. Several indicators, e.g., gravity and magnetic field anomalies, signs of hydrothermal activity, and geochemical match between AAT and potential source material point at the crater location in the Badain Jaran Desert in NW China, buried under sand megadunes. The talk presents a multi-element geochemical analysis of sand samples from drill cores in the Badain Jaran and Tengger Deserts by neutron activation analysis.

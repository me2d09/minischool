Graphene is a well-known 2D material. It has shown us an unparallel and huge number of properties, including superconductivity at magic angle etc. I will present a short talk on the use of Raman spectroscopy in probing graphene layers. Due to the absence of a bandgap in graphene, it makes all wavelengths of incident radiation resonant; thus, the Raman spectrum contains information about both atomic structure and electronic properties.

Modulation of Intesity with Zero effort (MIEZE) is a neutron spin echo spectroscopy technique for studying the dynamics of matter, which is used at FRM II at RESEDA. This talk presents the possible application of MIEZE experiments at pulsed neutron sources and compares it with the usage of continuous neutron sources.

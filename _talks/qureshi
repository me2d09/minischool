In this study, we investigated the structural and magnetic properties of single crystal NiBr2 to explore its magnetic anisotropy. The single crystals, grown via chemical vapor transport, were confirmed to have a trigonal structure (space group R-3m). Specific heat data revealed two magnetic phase transitions: an antiferromagnetic transition at 44 K and a helical incommensurate antiferromagnetic structure at 22.5 K. In-plane and out-of-plane Magnetic anisotropy explored using Torque Magnetometer setup in PPMS.

The current interest focused on nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is above all motivated by their various technical applications. The examples of wide range of usage include generation of new laser lines - e.g. second harmonic generation (SHG), stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), etc. - or applications in the field of optical communication. 

Nowadays crystal-engineering approaches are utilised for the preparation of materials with the desired symmetry. The carriers of NLO properties in the promising type of molecular crystals are organic cations with highly delocalised π-electron systems. These molecules are usually simple planar molecules exhibiting so-called “Y-aromaticity”. However, high values of their dipole moments usually lead to formation of unwanted centrosymmetric pairs. Therefore, inorganic acids, which can be inter-connected by hydrogen bonds (mostly N-H…N, N-H…O or O-H…O types) with the cations, are used as co-crystallisation partners. 
 
Synthesised compounds based on N-guanidyl-formamide were characterised mainly by the means of vibrational spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Quantum-chemical calculations were used for a prediction of NLO potential as well as for interpretation of recorded vibrational spectra. Lastly, measurements of SHG efficiency of powder samples with non-centrosymmetric crystal structures were performed.

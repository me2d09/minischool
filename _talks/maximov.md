Rare-earth (RE) orthoferrites have been extensively studied for their multiferroic properties and magnetic transitions due to interactions between Fe and RE magnetic sublattices. TbFeO3 in particular undergoes two spin-reorientation transitions: 
In the high-temperature phase (HT), only the Fe sublattice is ordered, whereas during the first transition, the Fe sublattice polarizes the Tb ions, causing both spins to rotate toward the b-axis (IT). Finally, the Tb sublattice orders antiferromagnetically while the Fe sublattice returns to its original HT state (LT).

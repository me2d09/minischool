The ability to combine ferromagnetic and ferroelectric responses in one material, is a promising and exciting focus of a study. Such material (referred to as magnetoelectric), would enable next-generation energy harvesting or drug delivery. Due to this, we will focus our research efforts on developing synthetic procedures for obtaining spinel@perovskite or perovskite@spinel core-shell structures and studying the origin of the coupling between the material’s physical properties.

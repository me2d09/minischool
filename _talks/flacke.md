Chiral magnetic textures, in particular magnetic skyrmions, are attractive for data storage and processing via magnetic "racetracks" and logic gates. These textures may also be used as neurotransmitters in artificial neural network, and even for quantum computing. For such applications, thin-film, all-metallic magnetic heterostructures with chiral magnetic texture stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) are ideal. Here, we investigate magnetic superlattices based on the low-damping and high saturation magnetization binary alloy Co<sub>25</sub>Fe<sub>75</sub> (CoFe). We detect the dynamic response of chiral magnetic texture within Pt/CoFe/Ir heterostructure multilayers via broadband FMR. The formation of chiral magnetic texture is confirmed by magnetic force microscopy and SQUID magnetometry measurements.

At low temperatures, the magnetic structure of the quasi 2D-insulator AF Ba2CuGe2O7 shows interesting behavior. Neutron scattering is used to reveal the nature of the phases as well as the transitions in order to complement bulk measurements. The influence of applied electrical field and the multiferroic properties of Ba2CuGe2O7 will be studied using SANS.

Geometrically frustrated magnets (GFM) are an intriguing class of magnetic materials, which hinge on competing magnetic interactions that cannot be simultaneously satisfied. This leads to the possibility of obtaining various exotic magnetic ground states, such as the quantum spin liquid (QSL) state. The QSL state is characterized by the presence of quantum entangled neighbouring spins and the absence of any long-range magnetic order. [1] The typical structures causing geometrical magnetic frustration are edge- or corner-sharing triangular or tetrahedral magnetic units with different spatial arrangement, resulting in triangular, pyrochlore, kagomé lattices, etc. The study of the QSL state has recently been extended from materials with 3d magnetic ions (such as Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup>) to heavier 4f or 5d magnetic ions with strong spin-orbit coupling, resulting in larger magnetic frustration. Our research will be focused on the recently discovered rare earth (RE) based triangular lattice antiferromagnets from the family REMAl<sub>11</sub>O<sub>19</sub> (RE = Pr, Nd, Sm–Tb; M = Mg, Zn). [2] The work will include crystal growth, structural analysis and magnetization measurements.

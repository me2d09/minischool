Perovskite solar cells are promising candidates to advance the solar energy industry due to their high power conversion efficiencies and low production costs by large-scale deposition methods. However, the resulting perovskite thin films suffer from low long-term stability. To solve this problem, a deep understanding of the crystallization phases in the perovskite deposition is needed. A possible way to get insight into those processes is through in-situ photoluminescence measurements. In-situ measurement results will be used to determine and optimize the influence of the process parameters to eventually improve the quality and durability of the perovskite solar cells.

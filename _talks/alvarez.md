We present the design of an ion trap experiment for studying nuclear-spin-changing collisions between H3+and H2. We will use action spectroscopy to observe the rotational population of the trapped H3+ions and to measure the rate coefficients of the nuclear-spin-changing processes. The experiment is designed with the help of a state-to-state kinetic model of the trapped ions.

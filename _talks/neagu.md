Neutron depth profiling (NDP) is a non-destructive, isotope-specific, high-resolution nuclear analytical technique, which is used to probe concentration profiles of lithium, boron, nitrogen, helium and several other light elements in different host materials. The status of the ongoing development towards 4D profiling is presented, where not only the concentration gradient, but also the lateral position of probes as well as its time evolution will be measured. By using a camera-obscura geometry setup, with a highly segmented Si-based detector with 32x266 strips, we aim for lateral resolutions down to 100µm x 100µm and highest time resolutions using a newly developed elliptical focusing neutron guide.

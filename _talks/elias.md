We are investigating the potential of hexaaluminates CeMgAl11O19 and EuAl12O19 for magnetic refrigeration. These materials are quasi-two-dimensional triangular lattice magnets with high magnetic anisotropy. Specific heat and magnetization measurements revealed a significant magnetocaloric effect at low temperatures.

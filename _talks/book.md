Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) is a powerful tool to investigate the atomic and magnetic structure of thin films. However, since the
phase information is lost during the PNR measurement, the reflectivity cannot be mapped uniquely to a scattering potential. To solve this so-
called phase-problem, reference layers can be used to reconstruct the phase information. The reference layer method is especially interesting for in situ PNR since two consecutive measurements can already be used to reconstruct the phase information. In this talk an in situ deposition chamber used for data acquisition and an introduction into phase reconstruction using the reference layer method will be presented.

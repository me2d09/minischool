Neutron and X-ray images frequently exhibit complementary contrast due to distinct underlying interaction mechanisms. Thus, comparing x-ray images with neutron images can provide additional information about the object. A dual-modality imaging system combines both X-ray computed tomography (CT) with neutron CT by simultaneously taking X-ray and neutron images.

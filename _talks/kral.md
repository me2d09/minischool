Rare earth-based 221 intermetallics crystallizing in tetragonal Mo2FeB2-type structure with possible geometrical frustration often exhibit exceptional magnetic properties intimately related to details of crystal lattice formed by two types of basal-plane sheets alternating along the c-axis. Exchange interactions between magnetic ions are sensitive to interatomic distances and the unique way, how to influence them without changes in chemical composition, is application of mechanical pressure.

An example of compound with interesting pressure effect on magnetic behavior is Ce2Pd2In showing two successive phase transitions at ambient pressure. Hydrostatic pressure is, according to the temperature evolution of crystal lattice, supposed to act more on the a-parameter, thus leads to approaching of atoms in basal plane, affecting the exchange interactions in the system and preference of antiferromagnetic phase over the ferromagnetic one. On the other hand, the uniaxial pressure as the unique tool for directly affecting the anisotropy acts on the parameter c showing no significant effect on the temperatures of phase transitions.

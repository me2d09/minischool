Over the years, high pressure researchers developed many techniques to apply high pressure, be it the famous diamond anvil cells capable of reaching tens of GPa (or even hundreds with multi-anvils), or the now common piston-cylinder cells capable of precise tuning of hydrostatic pressure up to 3 GPa. Among these techniques, exist the utilization of the so-called Bridgman anvil cells capable of creating hydrostatic and quasi-hydrostatic pressure up to 6.12 or even 20 GPa. How do they look? How do you work with them? Why would you ever work with them? These questions will be hopefully answered in this brief talk.

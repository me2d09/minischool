Starting with just a few simple and natural requirements for describing a physical system, we are led to an algebraic formulation. What's striking is that we make no as  sumptions about the nature of the system itself, allowing us to describe both classical and quantum systems within the same framework. By studying the transformations between these systems, we uncover the deformation process of quantization. This naturally raises the question: Can we also find a unified framework for field theories? The answer is yes, and it emerges through the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism of path integral quantization. Our work focuses on demonstrating that this structure is, once again, a natural consequence of requiring gauge invariance.

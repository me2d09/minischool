Heusler compounds that undergo martensitic transformation are of scientific interest due to their potential for future applications [1]. The most known alloy of this class is Ni-Mn-Ga, which has been intensively studied during the last decade as it exhibits magnetically induced reorientation [2]. The martensitic transformation to low symmetry phase,  which is the key to this  behavior,  can  be  tailored  by  proper  doping.  Detailed  understanding  of  changes  in  the electronic  structure  induced  by  doping  is  therefore  necessary  for  future  applications  of  these compounds.

Here I present optical and magneto-optical investigations of Co doped Ni-Mn-Ga film on MgO substrate grown by dc sputtering with focus on temperature  dependency in  order  to  examine  expected hysteresis when undergoing the martensitic transformation. The measurements were performed for the whole spectrum as well as for one of the prominent energy value at which a phenomenon occurs.

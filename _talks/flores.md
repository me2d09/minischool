(PbS)1.18VS2 is a layered material that present technologically relevant
properties such as polarization switching by layer sliding and enhanced
capacitance due to no-surface defects. Such properties are exclusive to
particular stacking configurations shaped by short-range correlations
between layers. In diffraction, correlations generate continuous
intensity patterns called diffuse scattering. Due to the large amount of
layers and their complex interactions diffuse scattering is not fully
understood. In this work, short-range correlations are retrieved by
means of diffuse scattering simulations and compared towards
experimental data.

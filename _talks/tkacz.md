We apply neutron grating interferometry (nGI) as a unique tool, to understand the relation of induced stresses through embossing and hot rolling to the altered local magnetic flux of nonoriented electrical steel (NOES).
A deeper understanding of this relation will enable us to build a better model and knowledge of nonuniform manufactured NOES sheets'  
time-dependent magnetic material properties in electromagnetic applications.

In Brazovskii scenario, a second-order phase transition is driven to become first-order, due to a large phase space available to the fluctuations involved. In this scenario, the fluctuations are not confined to a single point, but a manifold in momentum space. It was confirmed that such a phase-transition occurs in MnSi, where the manifold is a sphere. Neutron scattering experiments were conducted to examine the possibility of this scenario appearing in a 2D antiferromagnet - Ba<sub>2</sub>CuGe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> at zero field.

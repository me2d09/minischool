Henmilite (Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu(OH)<sub>4</sub>[B(OH)<sub>4</sub>]<sub>2</sub>) is only found in the Fuka mines of Japan, and has been suggested to consist of coupled two-leg ladders with an unusual antiferromagnetic dome in the phase diagram pointing to the existence of quantum fluctuations making it a possible quantum spin liquid candidate. We will present existing literature on this material and our first experimental results of the longitudinal thermal conductivity and the thermal Hall conductivity under an external magnetic field on Henmilite.

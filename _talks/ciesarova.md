Oxalates are simple, low-cost, but crucial compounds in the technology
of lanthanides, actinides, and transition metals. A newly developed
technique for large oxalate monocrystals growth was applied to the
whole lanthanide series, the resulting crystal structures were
reviewed. Surprisingly, most of the lanthanide oxalates can be easily
exfoliated, forming colloids of up to single-layered nanosheets.

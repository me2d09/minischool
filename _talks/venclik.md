There are multiple tools that are currently used to index a Laue pattern. Recently, there have been attempts to use Neural Networks for [fully automatic indexing](https://lauenn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/idea_lauenn/installation.html).  However, a real-world dataset for testing the efficiency and correctness of these programs is missing. It is my aim to use an automated process to create a database of indexed real-life Laue images of different structures that can serve as a testing dataset or a training dataset for any future neural networks.
